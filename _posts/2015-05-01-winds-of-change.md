It&#8217;s officially May 1st, 2015. The calendar page just flipped over and here I am, in my new home for three months &#8211; Greenville, South Carolina. I&#8217;ve only been in this city for three days.  A few minutes ago, I finished installing WordPress on my website for the first time. This is going to be my way of formally saying &#8220;Hello World.&#8221;

Flashback to over a year ago &#8211; early 2014. I had no definite idea where I was going to be living a year later (right now). My wife Erica and I were living in Germany at the time, and we both knew that change was-a-comin&#8217;. As for the future, the only thing that was certain was that I planned on making a huge career and life change in early 2015.  I would be transitioning from the military back to civilian life after almost eight years. But we had a real tough time settling on the details of that change, particularly the location where we&#8217;d move to. My somewhat-too-vague plan was to return to school to study Computer Science, which I originally studied in college before the inevitable shuffle of switching majors countless times.

Over the last decade I&#8217;ve become progressively more aware of the incredible opportunity humans have to change the world in countless ways through technology. Computers and more specifically, the Internet of today and the future provide an open path to to contribute to that change. I feel that I can be a part of that. Any time I&#8217;ve felt doubt in my capability to walk that path, I&#8217;ve returned to the inspiring words of Kevin Kelly &#8211; <a href="http://kk.org/thetechnium/2014/08/you-are-not-late/" target="_blank">You Are Not Late</a>. Don&#8217;t doubt &#8211; there are still so many ways in which we, and those that come after us, can craft reality out of imagination using the tools of the Internet and related technology we&#8217;ve been blessed with.

One weekend evening, I was in the midst of an hours-long obsessive spree comparing Computer Science programs of various colleges. A random online forum post mentioned something called a &#8220;coding bootcamp&#8221; and how the poster wished they could attend one. Little did I know, but I&#8217;d been sucked down another rabbit hole. Hours spent all night researching and comparing &#8220;coding bootcamps&#8221; or immersive coding schools turned into days, weeks, and months reading forum posts, blogs, emails, Reddit, Quora, e-books, and more.  I&#8217;d been out of the loop for a bit. I always bought the idea that education, particularly tech ed., required the standard four year university commitment. I was blown away by not only the growing number of these immersive code schools, but also the huge amount of self-education resources online that had sprung up especially within the last 3-4 years. So many choices, so much freedom&#8230; truly first world problems! I still remember excitedly explaining the entire concept to Erica during a long car trip. I can only imagine how crazy it sounded.

I&#8217;d soon set my mind to learn as much as possible on web development in my spare time with the goal of applying to the best-fit coding school towards the end of 2014. I had plenty of time on the calendar &#8211; surely I&#8217;d be able to learn a ton of stuff over the course of eight or nine months and have a ton of knowledge under my belt by the end of 2014, right? So, over the remainder of 2014, I crammed in some self-education whenever I had free time during my already time-consuming 65-hour work week. Let&#8217;s just say that it has been challenging, and not for lack of resources. I&#8217;ll sum up my experiences with that in my next post.

Forward to Fall of 2014. Erica and I agreed on the idea that once we initially returned from Germany, we would temporarily move in with some family in South Carolina who had opened their home to us. This would give us time to ease into living in the U.S. again and also give us a little extra time cushion to decide exactly where we would eventually move for good. I&#8217;ll be honest &#8211; South Carolina has never been at the top of (or even on) any list I&#8217;ve ever made of potential places to live. Having lived in the Southeastern USA for a good part of my earlier life, and in various other parts of the world since then, I was eager to choose our home in an area that was, frankly, more superficially exciting and interesting than South Carolina. That judgment of mine is undoubtedly colored by stereotypes and prejudices and biases within me. Looking back, moving here has been a great stepping stone. Right now, I am incredibly grateful to our family for welcoming us into to their home and enabling this current path in life for Erica and I.

Continuing my online research of coding schools led me to to check out whether there were any viable alternatives nearer to where we&#8217;d be at. I was originally set on the idea of moving out west to one of the traditional tech hubs like Seattle / San Fran / Austin, etc. for a few months to attend school, but I was also dreading the financial hit that came with that. I was surprised to discover a code school headquartered in nearby Greenville, SC that was was also rapidly expanding throughout the country &#8211; <a href="http://theironyard.com/" target="_blank">The Iron Yard Academy</a>. Reviews and student blogs from past students seemed almost entirely 100% positive. I reached out to make contact with The Iron Yard in November 2014 and still remember talking on the phone to the Roy, the Greenville Campus Director, for the first time. Just actually talking to someone about coding, technology, my hopes and what the school had to offer was a refreshing new experience for me. Until then, this move into technology and web development had only been an abstract idea in my mind, maybe jotted on a few scattered scraps of notes I&#8217;d made, or discussed between Erica and I. I hadn&#8217;t shared it with anyone else. As with many things in life, the first step in turning this plan into a concrete reality was one of the most difficult but also rewarding steps.

Fast forward to Feb 6, 2015. We had been back in the U.S. for just over a month. I&#8217;d recieved the official email from the Iron Yard that they had accepted my application to attend their Front-End Engineering course in May 2015. The countdown had begun.

In the week leading up to the school I&#8217;ve been lucky to be able to attend and volunteer at a tech conference in Greenville for the last three days &#8211; <a href="http://greenvillegrok.com/" target="_blank">GROK</a>. This is the first time I&#8217;ve attended any type of professional conference, and I have to say that even with all that I&#8217;ve taught myself so far, I&#8217;m feeling *just* a bit of our old friend the <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5928639/feel-like-youre-faking-it-that-might-not-be-a-bad-thing" target="_blank">Imposter Syndrome</a> here, being around so many interesting and successful people who are living the dream. At the same time, it&#8217;s been a fascinating and huge relief that literally *every* single person I&#8217;ve met has been incredibly welcoming, encouraging, positive, and open towards me. The web development community at large and especially the Greenville subset of it are very open to sharing, encouraging, and helping others, which is just so cool. I&#8217;ve tried my best to be a sponge and absorb as much good advice and knowledge from the wide variety of people here &#8211; web designers, digital marketers, web developers, educators, entrepreneurs, and also former students of the Iron Yard. Top it off with some great lectures and a kickass musical performance from <a href="http://www.moldover.com" target="_blank">Moldover</a>. It&#8217;s been a great tech experience and really enjoyable introduction to the Greenville community.

I have one weekend left until Day 1 of the Iron Yard Academy on Monday. I can&#8217;t wait to get started, to meet the other students and hear their stories, and to devote myself to learning, building, and growing with them. I&#8217;ll share something cool that I saw today that visually represents some of the magic that, together, we can surf on together:
