title: The Thrill of Learning Twenty-Year-Old Technologies

Almost two months ago, while I was engaged in a full-time job hunt, I was happy to find a reply email in my inbox for a junior front-end developer opening I had applied to.  When opening it, I was intrigued to see that the place where I'd applied had requested the dreaded "preliminary development prototype test".  Unpaid work, estimated to take between 6-14 hours to finish, in order to assess my skills.

Generally I would frown on doing any unpaid work (1-2 days worth!) just as part of applying for a job, but in this case the job seemed promising and, well... I had free time on my hands.


So, I put on my web-dev coder hat and decided to knock this out. 6-14 hours? *Ha, so that means I can finish this in a day, right?*

### The task:

* Chopping up a set of PSDs and replicating a pixel-perfect-ish mockup w/ HTML/CSS (*check - I got this*)
* Using several pre-defined responsive breakpoints to mimic the supplied PSDs at varying screen resolutions (*check - I got this*)
* Adding a sticky-nav that drops down vertically from the top of the screen as the user enters "below-the-fold" - (*check - I got this*)
* Adding custom CSS hover-effects over and a lightbox on-click for components of the page (*check - I got this*)

These were all things that I'd done before, and given 6-14 hours, could definitely throw together at a proficient level.  Then I saw...

* A basic PHP/mySQL execution storing a user-entered form value in a mySQL database via AJAX (*Hold on...*)

Wait, wat?!?  PHP? mySQL?  That wasn't in the job description!  I'm a front-end developer - I use HTML/CSS/Javascript!  I immediately started questioning if I had the chops to bother with this demo assessment.  I'd never done *any* coding with PHP or mySQL.  A little voice in the back of my head told me that there's no way I could figure that out in 6-14 hours.  Especially considering that I'd never sent form data to a PHP back-end via AJAX, nor used PHP to save data to a mySQL database that I needed to create.  

*How do you even create a mySQL database? Maybe I should just mark this job opportunity off of my list...*

But, luckily, another voice in my head told myself that maybe, just *maybe*, I could figure this out.  Hope started to resurface.  I thought back on all the other instances of how I'd actually learned and used new technology stacks in relatively short amounts of time and thought I'd investigate a little more.

I quickly shot off a couple messages to my instructor from The Iron Yard, and another willing mentor from [Operation Code](https://operationcode.org/).  "Is this something that I, as a complete n00b to PHP/mySQL, can actually teach myself to do and complete in approximately one-day's time?"  In essence, I was asking for reassurance.  And they responded that, YES, I could, and that this wasn't conceptually too much different than what I'd already been doing with Javascript and Parse/noSQL, just slight syntax changes.  That's all I needed to hear.  Thanks, guys!

So I set out on yet another coding quest along with my trusty companions named Google and Stack Overflow.  Ultimately, after hitting up several tutorials, Youtube videos, and even the infamous W3schools.com along the way, I ended up completing the demo assessment.  All requirements achieved.  With functioning PHP/mySQL.  It actually worked, and looked pretty damn good.  Not in 6-14 hours.  More like 20.

The funny thing was that the PHP/mySQL part didn't even take up the majority of my time.  That scary new tech stack that initially presented itself as such a challenge probably only took a couple hours.  A bunch of the other stuff that I thought would be a complete breeze ended up presenting some unexpected challenges and taking a *little* longer than I'd thought.

And at the end of the day, did I get the job?  Of course not - that'd be just a little too good of an ending to this blog post, wouldn't it?

What I did end up with was an experience that was just as satisfying - not necessarily in a materialistic "I got a job!" way, but in a child-like "I love learning!" way.  I saw that I could continue to replicate the concepts that schools like The Iron Yard impress upon their students.  I saw that by taking a measured, confident, planned approach to learning new tech stacks and tools, that it's possible to succeed and put those tech stacks and tools to use relatively quickly.

Yes, I know that PHP/mySQL aren't exactly the New Hotness in 2015.  I just looked it up, and both were released in 1995!  But, nonetheless, figuring out the basics of how they work for the first time was pretty damn fun.  

As a programmer, I know this situation will keep presenting itself.  New and unexpected problems will continue to arise.  But instead of instantly backing down from them, or instantly attacking them, sometimes it's better to pause, seek sage advice,  draft a plan of action, and then... go to work.
