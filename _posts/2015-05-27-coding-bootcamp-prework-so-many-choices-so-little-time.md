> &#8220;You&#8217;re doing it wrong. You need to be building minor things the entire time. You will never get to the point where you start building stuff if it&#8217;s always in the future. And this is coming from someone who just taught themselves. You need to be building from the beginning.&#8221;

&#8211; <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/315t3v/learn_html5_from_w3c_is_this_course_good_for/" target="_blank">diabetesjones on Reddit</a>

I randomly found the above quote on the /r/webdev subreddit two months ago.  I wish I&#8217;d read it and followed that advice about six months earlier.    It summarizes what I think is one of the most effective approaches to learning coding &#8211; *actually building thing*s.   This is one of the hands-on methods used often at <a href="http://theironyard.com/" target="_blank">The Iron Yard</a> .  Before attending, I spent over three months doing self-study or &#8220;pre-work&#8221; to prepare.  However, with a thirst for knowledge and unrealistic desire to &#8220;master it all&#8221;, I didn&#8217;t spend nearly enough time actually using what I&#8217;d learned.   Add in a typical first-world problem &#8211; too many choices!  The growing number of online coding education resources and choices out there is staggering.  Instead of completing one learning path, I&#8217;d inevitably compare what I was working on with another website/text/tutorial and switch over to something else because I thought it would somehow be &#8220;better&#8221;.  And, once I learned new syntax or techniques, I often made the mistake of immediately diving into another without fully applying what I&#8217;d learned.   Bottom-line: regardless of what path you&#8217;re learning &#8211; stop afterwards and actually *build* some projects so that what you&#8217;ve learned sinks in!

Today marked the beginning of Week Four at The Iron Yard&#8217;s Front-End Engineering Course.  Regardless of how I could have approached it better, I can confidently say that the three+ months that I spent on pre-work have been a *huge* help so far.   Having a familiarity with HTML/CSS and Javascript syntax has been a lifesaver.  A month before the class began, our instructor Jake emailed out a list of recommended pre-work that covered the bare-bones &#8211; a few Codecademy courses, Treehouse tutorials, and few other web-based reads &#8211; the very basic stuff.  This shouldn&#8217;t be only recommended &#8211; it should be *required*.

Different coding bootcamps have different approaches &#8211; some schools market themselves as only accepting students who are already 20% on the way to being an employable web-developer and require huge amounts of pre-work to achieve that level, while others (The Iron Yard included) push a &#8220;zero-to-hero&#8221; approach that offers to teach students who have little-to-no coding experience and with very light pre-work.  Personally, I would recommend that anyone seeking to attend *any* coding bootcamp spend a significant amount of time preparing before class starts.    That way, once class starts, you&#8217;re not spending time trying to learn the basics of syntax and can focus on actually applying what you know and tackling more advanced topics as possible.  In our class, there have been some students that did not complete very much pre-work, due to any number of  legitimate reasons, and I will venture to say that the first few weeks have been more challenging for them as a result.

I will preface this by acknowledging that  I was very lucky to have a few months where I was able to concentrate on learning via the various online self-ed resources, and not everyone has that luxury.  Work, school, family, you name it &#8211; life happens and priorities come first.    That being said, the more time you can devote to this, the farther ahead of the game you&#8217;ll be once class actually starts.  You&#8217;re paying for this learning experience, it&#8217;s not cheap, and once it starts, the content starts flying at you fast.

Below are some of the resources I used.  While doing so, I did find myself hopping around from one resource to the next without necessarily finishing any of them entirely.  If any of these resources aren&#8217;t helping you, don&#8217;t be afraid to switch to one that works for you.  In my opinion, it doesn&#8217;t matter as much what learning resource you use, or the order you in which you do them, but instead,  *what you build with your new knowledge.*

<a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106a/" target="_blank">Stanford CS106A: Programming Methodology</a>: Shout-out to <a href="http://natashatherobot.com/" target="_blank">Natasha the Robot</a> on this recommendation. This is an actual Stanford university course that has 100% of its lecture videos, slides and coursework posted online for free. Possibly one of the best introductory lessons in object-oriented programming and fundamentals. For anyone getting into programming, regardless of language, this is a great starting point. It doesn&#8217;t necessarily focus on web development, but the lecturer (Mehran Sahami) does an excellent job of explaining things to a beginner in a way that makes sense. Gotta love Karel the Robot. (Java)

<a href="http://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>:  One of the more popular sites out there with a very user-friendly UI. Codecademy catches some flak sometimes, but overall, it&#8217;s a solid intro to coding and easy to try it out directly in your web browser w/o requiring an install. It&#8217;s nice to learn basic syntax and see the results right away. They hold your hand a bit and almost literally tell you what syntax to type occasionally, but sometimes that&#8217;s what beginners need. However, once this starts to seem the slightest bit non-challenging, I suggest moving on to something more mind-engaging. (Ruby, Javascript, HTML/CSS tracks, + more)

<a href="https://dash.generalassemb.ly/" target="_blank">General Assembly Dash</a>:  Similar to Codecademy, but uses the theme of coding sample projects for real clients to resemble a real project you could actually work on. Ultimately, this didn&#8217;t offer enough repetition for me to really grasp anything, but it&#8217;s good to work through for a couple days just for the practice. (HTML/CSS, minimal Javascript/ jQuery)

<a href="https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/" target="_blank">Epicodus /  Learnhowtoprogram.com</a>:  An actual bricks-and-mortars coding bootcamp in Oregon that has also generously posted their entire curriculum online with video lectures for each topic. The actual school is very affordable compared to its peers and from what I&#8217;ve read, they actually offer a very top-notch learning experience. The online curriculum was being updated and shuffled around as I went through it, which presented some challenges, but hey, it&#8217;s free, so I won&#8217;t knock it. Good stuff. (HTML/CSS/Ruby/Javascript)

<a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/" target="_blank">Odin Project</a>: An open-source, free, online track system to grow &#8220;full stack&#8221; developers. It mainly links to external sites like Codecademy or CodeSchool, but also has some nice coding challenges and informational articles. The founders have since started a paid online coding bootcamp called Viking Code School which also has a nice set of free pre-work uploaded online for others to poach. (Various languages)

<a href="https://www.bento.io/" target="_blank">Bento</a>: A free collection of resources with a track setup for aspiring web developers. Similar to Odin Project in that it links to some external resources. Covers just about any area of web development anyone is interested in. (Various languages)

<a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp.com</a>: 800 hours of online coding challenges, mostly links to external sites like CodeSchool, CodeAcademy, or Treehouse tutorials. It also has a nice forum and chatroom with really friendly fellow students and developers. The cool thing about this site is that once you complete their challenges, they also link up students with real-world non-profits who need assistance with online projects. They claim to offer another 800 hours of experience working with non-profits. (Mainly Javascript + frameworks)

<a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/" target="_blank">Treehouse</a>: A very nice array of online video tutorials covering a wide swath of web design and web development topics. They have a nice feature where you can either download the tutorial code to work with in your own text editor alongside the instructor, or you can code along with the instructor using their workspaces which are integrated into the website. The instructors are skilled at explaining code as they show you in an easy-to-understand manner. One thing about this site is that the tutorials move along at a rather slow pace, likely so they don&#8217;t leave beginners behind. Luckily, you can speed up the videos to 2x speed if needed. That being said, this is another great place to learn the fundamentals and they cover a LOT of areas with new videos coming out all the time. I plan on continuing to use this service going forward simply because they offer so much good content.

Textbooks:

<a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/" target="_blank">Eloquent Javascript</a> (by Marijn Haverbeke): This book was highly recommended as the best one on Javascript currently available. The author&#8217;s writing style is very informal and personable, and he also does a great job of explaining some more advanced Javascript concepts early on in the book. Ultimately, for a beginner, this book may not be the best choice. Chapters 5 and 6 delve into higher-order functions and it is easy to get lost following some of the code examples. The code challenges at the end of each chapter are great learning opportunities, though. Another nice thing is that the 2nd edition book is freely available on the website and allows you to enter and experiment with all the code directly on the website using a code sandbox feature.

<a href="http://javascript.crockford.com/" target="_blank">Javascript: The Good Parts</a> (by Douglas Crockford): A more concise text than Eloquent Javascript that covers the fundamentals of Javascript and does a good job at highlighting the &#8220;good parts&#8221; of the language (and addressing the not-so-good).  Written in a somewhat terse style and hampered by some unneeded logic diagrams at beginning.  In all, a good intro to study, along with some good &#8220;best-practice&#8221; examples provided by the author.

<a href="http://www.headfirstlabs.com/books/hfhtml5prog/" target="_blank">Headfirst HTML5 Programming </a>(by Eric Freeman & Elizabeth Robson): A text covering many of the newer feature of HTML5 and integrating it with Javascript. It has a funky layout and presents the material with a lot of humorous graphics. Each chapter focuses quite nicely on just one HTML5 API and guides you on a real-world example of integrating it onto a website. I found this book to be a very nice transition from Vanilla Javascript to actually using Javascript with the Document Object Model.

Disclaimer: The term *&#8220;coding bootcamp&#8221;* has a strange ring to it, just doesn&#8217;t sound very professional, and is kinda unauthentic.   Part of me is saying that because I&#8217;ve actually experienced a real military &#8220;bootcamp&#8221; (aka Basic Combat Training in the Army), and the other part is because this term  reminds me of the personal fitness &#8220;bootcamps&#8221; that are all the rage these days.   Regardless,   I&#8217;ve seen some other terms thrown around, from ALP (<a href="https://m.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/skills_report.pdf" target="_blank">Accelerated Learning Program</a> per the White House), to immersive code school, etc.  But the term that&#8217;s most widespread in the common lexicon so far is coding bootcamp, so&#8230; if you can&#8217;t beat &#8217;em, join &#8217;em.

Success is in the struggle.
