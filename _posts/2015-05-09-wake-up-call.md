That&#8217;s my visual summary of week one at The Iron Yard.  I was the big dumb dog who wanted to play, and The Iron Yard fired back with a playful jab.  It wasn&#8217;t really that bad, but it was sort of a wake-up call.  This is gonna be challenging.  Maybe a bit painful.  But I&#8217;m damn sure it&#8217;ll be fun.


So far this week we&#8217;ve covered the following topics in the course:

**Git/Github:**  Here&#8217;s the TLDR; &#8211; do NOT use the Github app.

Other than that, Git/Github and version control in general is an awesome concept that I really want to learn more about and utilize effectively as part of a team.  We covered the basics and everyone in class is now committing/pushing work on the reg.  I&#8217;ve been on teams in the past that were hampered by use of technology and did not optimize communication or workflow.  Git can solve that problem, especially when coupled with a strong knowledge of command-line.

**HTML/CSS:** We&#8217;ve done a general review of the basics of both.  This weekend&#8217;s project is replicating a pixel-perfect website design of a .PNG mockup of an already-styled site.  So far, I haven&#8217;t learned many new elements, selectors, or properties I hadn&#8217;t already been exposed to, but this assignment is damn sure making sure that we actually have to use a HUGE variety of HTML/CSS.  I may have shied away from using things like CSS letter-spacing properties or transitions earlier, even though I was aware of their existence and what they did.  Now we&#8217;re being forced to use them, and that&#8217;s a nice nudge in the right direction.

Our instructor Jake has also introduced us to a ton of useful apps, packages, customizations, extensions, and also some workflow and time-management strategies which, combined, will all make development much, much easier.  Good stuff which I am glad to be exposed to from someone who&#8217;s been there, done that.

Next week, we should dive right into CSS preprocessors, vanilla Javascript, basic DOM traversal, and more.  The pace looks to be accelerating.  I&#8217;m excited.

So I&#8217;m looking back at my last post, which I wrote almost immediately before the course at <a href="http://www.theironyard.com/academy" target="_blank">The Iron Yard</a> began, and thinking about what was on my mind. Going in to this, I had a pretty solid plan of what, outside of coding, I intended to do in order to succeed here.   The following pretty much sums up how I&#8217;d grade myself on those subtasks:

  1. **Short workout daily**  
    *Grade: D*  
    I&#8217;d planned to do a mini-workout every day from 6:00 a.m. to 6:30 a.m.  Guess how many days I did that?  Yep, one &#8211; Monday, the first day.  After that, sleep won out.  The amount of info loaded into you here coupled with the self-expectation to sponge it in and complete the daily assignments has kept me up late each night.  I will be able to get in a quality run this weekend, thanks to the advice on local run routes from another Iron Yard grad.  Greenville&#8217;s <a href="https://spencerwyckoff.wordpress.com/2015/01/31/my-morning-routine/" target="_blank">Swamp Rabbit Trail</a> looks awesome.
  2. **Eat relatively healthy**  
    *Grade: B-*  
    I&#8217;d aimed to eat plenty of veggies/protein and avoid starchy carbs and garbage fats.  I did pretty good, thanks to the idea of pre-cooking in bulk the weekend before the class and eating that for lunch most days.  Some food that my wife and mother-in-law sent along with me didn&#8217;t hurt, either. A couple slices of pizza did sneak in during the week- that was my doing.  I can do better.
  3. **Daily meditation  &  time devoted to spiritual growth, daily & weekly**  
    *Grade: C*  
    Same as working out.   I fit in two very short 5-minute meditation sessions during the week, but that&#8217;s all.  I&#8217;d already joined a month-long online Buddhist meditation event hosted by <a href="http://www.wildmind.org/" target="_blank">Wildmind</a> that I found very beneficial in the past.  With the full plate of class work, though, that was left to the wayside.    There&#8217;s always the weekend (and homework to do on the weekend).  Smaller but more regular sessions may have to do.  I know this is important and shouldn&#8217;t be forgotten.
  4. **Focus on the task at hand (learning as much as I can) and work my ass off**  
    *Grade: B-*  
    Ok, this is related to coding.  I&#8217;m pretty happy with how I&#8217;ve approached the workload so far.  I did veer slightly off course for the first three hours of Friday lab today trying to troubleshoot an annoying problem w/ an external monitor display, but I ended up staying at the lab until close to midnight to make up for it. Bottom line, avoid distractions and focus on the most important task at hand.

As you can see, I haven&#8217;t been perfect.  You could even say that on some days I&#8217;ve failed at things.  At today&#8217;s AM class session we had our Friday morning huddle, which is essentially an open forum for students and instructor(s) to speak on anything they wish. One of my classmates  stressed the importance of not dwelling on a perceived failure to execute a task, or class assignment to the 100% assigned external standard and instead focus on just how much stuff we are learning.  We were discussing the concept of <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/" target="_blank">Fixed vs. Growth mindset</a>.  Just now I&#8217;m reminded again how important that is.  What&#8217;s important is that no matter how imperfect, unpolished, or non-functioning anything we build right now might be, we are still learning and growing a tremendous amount, especially when compared to what we once knew or could do.  For me, that relates not only to my growth as a software developer, but also that above habits that I mentioned.  Failure is growth.

Luckily, just about everyone at the class seems to be just as motivated to learn this stuff and also just as interested in it, which really is new to me.   I&#8217;ve met some really cool and very intelligent people so far.  Here&#8217;s to all of our continued growth during this weekend&#8217;s project assignment and all throughout next week.<figure style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

There&#8217;s gonna be a GoT season 5 marathon once this class is over.  I&#8217;ve already missed too much of this season &#8211; it&#8217;s killing me!
